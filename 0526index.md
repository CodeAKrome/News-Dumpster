- Summary:  
    Good evening, we begin with the escalating crisis in Gaza. Israeli military operations have intensified, with strikes on over 200 targets, including a school-turned-shelter, resulting in dozens of deaths, including nine children of a Gaza doctor. The humanitarian situation is dire, with less than 5% of arable land suitable for cultivation and minimal aid reaching desperate families, leaving babies at risk of starvation. The UN and international leaders, including the UK, France, and Canada, are urging Israel to end its offensive, while a British surgeon describes the harrowing conditions in Gaza’s hospitals. Amidst the chaos, Hamas claims a new aid plan is an Israeli intelligence operation, and their fighters remain unpaid due to blockades. However, there’s a glimmer of hope as aid trucks reportedly entered via Kerem Shalom, though initiatives face significant hurdles, including the resignation of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s director. Hamas has agreed to a ceasefire proposal, but Israel rejected a plan involving hostage releases, as violence spills into Jerusalem’s Old City, underscoring the deep tensions in the region.

Violence erupted in the Old City, with clashes tied to historical grievances, while the Israel Land Fund and MK Tzvi Succot emphasized a strong Jewish presence, raising the Israeli flag on the Temple Mount. The government approved financial aid to relocate embassies to Jerusalem, signaling its strategic importance.

- Summary:  
    In the Middle East, Iran remains a focal point of tension and diplomacy. Reports suggest Israel is contemplating strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, defying U.S. objections, while Iran’s army commander warns of a forceful response to any provocation. Tehran rejected a proposed Middle East nuclear consortium and dismissed temporary agreements with Washington, with its foreign minister denying delays in U.S. talks. European officials, however, accuse Iran of stalling to evade sanctions. Iran is also strengthening ties with Turkey, Pakistan, and Iraq, while hosting a Hamas delegation amid escalating Gaza operations. In Syria, U.S. envoy Barrack’s meeting with the Syrian president signals a push for peace, but Iran’s execution of a man linked to a 2023 Azerbaijan embassy attack underscores its hardline stance. Uncertainty persists as Iran navigates nuclear red lines and regional ambitions.

- Summary:  
    The Russia-Ukraine conflict continues to intensify, with devastating consequences. Russia launched a record number of drone strikes on Ukraine, killing at least 12, including children, in the largest aerial bombardment of the war. Ukrainian forces admitted to military sites near Kyiv being hit, while Russian troops advanced, liberating areas like Belovody and Romanovka, and expanding a buffer zone near Kursk. Reports of Ukrainian troops fleeing and executing Russian captives in the Donetsk region have sparked outrage. In response, Ukraine’s air defenses faced 96 drones targeting Russian regions, with a notable attack on Putin’s helicopter in Kursk. A Russian couple turned informants for Ukraine, denying treason, while Trump faced pressure to act after calling Putin “crazy.” Amidst the violence, a reported Hamas-Israel ceasefire agreement adds complexity, as the Kremlin justifies strikes as retaliation for attacks on Russian civilians.

The Kremlin accuses European politicians of derailing Russia-Ukraine talks and slams lifted missile range restrictions as dangerous. Meanwhile, Poland plans major military drills in response to Russian-Belarusian exercises, and NATO’s growing presence raises concerns. Russia maintains contact with U.S. intelligence and plans to discuss Ukraine with Turkey, though no progress has been made on a peace treaty with Kyiv. The SCO supports direct negotiations, while Russia pledges continued counter-terrorism aid to Africa. Conflicting reports on a Hamas ceasefire proposal highlight Russia’s broader diplomatic entanglements, as a Luxembourgish MP’s Moscow visit signals ongoing European engagement in the Ukraine crisis.

- Summary:  
    In Japan, a mix of innovation, culture, and economic challenges is shaping the news. Two flights, including an ANA Tokyo-U.S. route, made emergency landings after passengers attempted to open doors mid-flight, raising aviation safety concerns. Economically, Japan is grappling with U.S. tariffs, prompting a 900 billion yen stimulus package, while Nissan bets on hybrid EV technology to revive its fortunes. Japan Post’s new 7-digit address codes and the recognition of Taiwan in family registries signal social progress. The University of Tokyo is considering accepting Harvard students amid potential U.S. restrictions. Culturally, a high-tech Osaka Expo show featuring Kabuki star Nakamura Shido and Vocaloid Hatsune Miku, alongside a revised no-smoking policy, highlights Japan’s blend of tradition and innovation. However, a farm minister’s resignation over tone-deaf rice remarks underscores political sensitivities.

Trump delayed 50% tariffs on the EU until July 9, but market watchers warn of potential trade volatility, with businesses turning to AI and legal workarounds to navigate the turbulence. His tax bill, facing Senate skepticism, and a $3 billion grant reallocation from Harvard to trade schools signal bold economic shifts. Trump’s West Point address pushed military reforms, while his acceptance of a Qatar gift jet raised eyebrows. On foreign policy, Trump’s remarks on Russia’s Ukraine strikes, attributed to “emotional strain” by the Kremlin, have prompted calls for action, with the U.S. cautious about new arms supplies to Ukraine to avoid antagonizing Russia. NATO’s upcoming summit faces potential disruptions from Trump or Zelensky, and his vision for China and Russia remains a focal point.
