Moscow is preparing comprehensive documentation for ceasefire discussions while continuing military operations. Russian officials indicate that draft memorandums from both sides are nearing completion and will be released soon. However, the Kremlin maintains secrecy about specific document contents.

**Summary:** Ukrainian President Zelensky has proposed a trilateral summit involving himself, Putin, and Trump. "We are prepared for a Trump-Putin-Zelensky formula, and we are ready for individual meetings - Trump and Putin and, Trump and Zelensky - as well as a trilateral meeting. These should be simultaneous meetings, not separate", Zelensky stated. However, tensions have escalated between Trump and Putin, with Trump and Putin talking for more than two hours in recent calls. Trump has warned Putin about "playing with fire" and criticized Russian actions, while Putin rejected Trump's Vatican-mediated peace proposal, with the Kremlin describing Trump as "emotional." Trump said Russia and Ukraine will "immediately" start negotiations toward a ceasefire, though concrete progress remains limited. The diplomatic triangle reflects complex dynamics where personal relationships between leaders could determine Ukraine's future.

Russia claims that European nations are sabotaging trilateral peace initiatives led by Russia, the United States, and Turkey. This suggests competing diplomatic tracks, with Turkey maintaining its position as a key mediator between the warring parties, while European allies express skepticism about peace processes that might compromise Ukraine's territorial integrity or security guarantees.

**Summary:** President Zelensky made a crucial visit to Berlin on May 28, 2025, meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz to secure additional military support. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will leave Berlin with a new €5 billion ($5.7bn) arms package as Germany reinforces its position as the second-largest supplier of military aid to Ukraine. During the talks, Zelensky warned of 50,000 Russian troops gathering near Sumy, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced defensive capabilities. Both Zelensky and Merz spoke about their frustration with Russia regarding peace negotiations, in particular a promise about a memorandum from Moscow following a call between Putin and US President Donald Trump on May 19, which doesn't appear to have yet materialized. While Zelensky secured pledges for long-range weapons support, Germany continued to withhold its advanced Taurus missiles, reflecting ongoing debates about escalation risks.

**Summary:** NATO dynamics regarding Ukraine show mixed signals, with reports of cold reception for Ukrainian delegates at NATO parliamentary assembly meetings, suggesting potential shifts in American support. However, NATO members are preparing to increase defense spending commitments to five percent of GDP, partly in response to Trump administration pressure.

**Summary:** The debate over long-range weapons continues to be contentious, with the United States maintaining restrictions on the range of weapons supplied to Ukraine. However, some of Ukraine's allies are moving to lift bans on firing long-range missiles at Russian territory, prompting strong criticism from the Kremlin. This reflects ongoing strategic debates about escalation management versus providing Ukraine with sufficient defensive capabilities to repel Russian advances.

**Summary:** US-Russia relations under the Trump administration show uncertainty, with the president remaining undecided on additional sanctions against Russia. The State Department has clarified that Trump's recent statements about Russia should not be interpreted as disappointment with diplomatic efforts. Trump's special envoy Kellogg noted the souring of relations between Trump and Putin, with the US president warning Russia about "playing with fire." This suggests a more complicated diplomatic relationship than initially anticipated, with personal dynamics between leaders affecting broader policy directions.

**Summary:** European unity on Ukraine faces internal pressures, with Hungarian Prime Minister Orbán accused of exploiting Ukraine-related spy controversies for domestic political gain. German leadership under Chancellor Merz has taken a more assertive stance, with experts suggesting Europeans are preparing for potential confrontation with Russia. Berlin's rhetoric appears designed to demonstrate to the Trump administration that Russia genuinely opposes peace. Germany's foreign minister has committed to continuing sanctions escalation against Russia, though critics label some German weapons decisions as "foreign policy illiteracy." Meanwhile, US-EU trade tensions complicate transatlantic coordination on Ukraine policy, with both sides navigating competing economic and security priorities.

**Summary:** The International Olympic Committee has maintained its ban on Russian teams for the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina, continuing the sporting isolation of Russia that began with the Ukraine invasion. This decision reflects the international community's commitment to maintaining consequences for Russian actions, extending beyond military and economic sanctions to cultural and sporting spheres. The ban affects Russian athletes' participation in international competitions and serves as another form of diplomatic pressure.

## Key Focus on Ukraine

Throughout these developments, Ukraine remains at the center of complex international negotiations while continuing to face military pressure. President Zelensky's diplomatic activities, from proposing trilateral summits with Trump and Putin to securing additional military aid from Germany, demonstrate Ukraine's active efforts to maintain international support while exploring peace opportunities. The situation reflects the delicate balance between military defense, diplomatic engagement, and the challenge of securing favorable terms in any potential settlement. Ukraine's position appears strengthened by continued Western military support, though the changing dynamics of US leadership under Trump introduce new uncertainties about long-term backing.

   - **Peace Talks**:
     - Istanbul talks (May 16, 2025) resulted in a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner swap and agreements to draft ceasefire memorandums (6558, 6560, 6562, 6574).
     - Russia is finalizing its memorandum but avoids public disclosure to prevent media leaks (6574, 6575).
     - Turkey offers to host further talks and mediate, emphasizing Black Sea navigation safety (6563).

### Narrative Picture

The geopolitical landscape surrounding Ukraine in May 2025 is a volatile mix of military escalation, diplomatic maneuvering, and internal divisions among allies. Russia’s aggressive posture—marked by troop buildups in Sumy, drone attacks, and territorial gains—signals a strategic push to weaken Ukraine before any ceasefire takes hold. President Putin’s call for a “buffer zone” reflects a long-term goal to secure Russia’s borders, but his reluctance to commit to immediate ceasefire terms has frustrated US President Trump, who sees personal diplomacy as key to de-escalation. Ukraine, under Zelenskyy, remains resilient, countering Russian advances and launching drone strikes while seeking Western support and peace talks.

Turkey’s role as a mediator, hosting talks in Istanbul and offering further facilitation, positions it as a neutral broker, though its NATO membership complicates its equidistance. Germany, a steadfast Ukrainian ally, balances military aid with caution against escalation, as seen in Chancellor Merz’s contradictory statements on weapon restrictions. The EU, while broadly supportive, faces internal fractures, with Hungary’s pro-Russia stance and opposition to Ukraine’s EU membership creating tension. Hungary’s diplomatic spat with Ukraine, involving expulsions and spying accusations, underscores its outlier status within NATO and the EU.

Parallels between Ukraine’s fight for self-determination and the Israel-Gaza conflict highlight a perceived Western double standard, as noted by analysts. Moldova’s pro-EU shift and resistance to Russian influence align it with Ukraine, while Poland’s election reflects broader regional debates over NATO and EU integration. The Jewish community in Ukraine, preparing for Shavuot amid war, symbolizes resilience but also the human toll of ongoing conflict.

### Predictions and Likely Outcomes

1. **Military Stalemate with Escalation Risks**:
   - Russia’s troop buildup and drone attacks suggest a summer offensive aimed at stretching Ukraine’s forces. However, Ukraine’s counterattacks and Western aid may prevent significant territorial losses, leading to a prolonged stalemate.
   - The risk of escalation grows if Western-supplied long-range weapons (e.g., Taurus missiles) are used against Russian territory, potentially drawing NATO closer to direct involvement (6628, 6635).

2. **Peace Talks Progress Slowly**:
   - The Istanbul talks’ prisoner swap and memorandum drafting indicate a diplomatic channel, but Russia’s stalling and demand for Ukrainian neutrality (6595) suggest negotiations will drag into late 2025.
   - Trump’s personal diplomacy may yield a temporary truce, but deep-seated issues like Ukraine’s NATO aspirations and Russia’s territorial demands will delay a lasting agreement.

3. **EU and NATO Divisions Persist**:
   - Hungary’s resistance to EU sanctions and Ukraine’s NATO membership will continue to strain EU unity (6623). Poland’s election outcome may further polarize regional support for Ukraine.
   - NATO’s hesitation to invite Zelenskyy to its June summit (6640) signals caution, potentially emboldening Russia.

4. **Regional Ripple Effects**:
   - Moldova’s pro-EU trajectory will strengthen its alignment with Ukraine, but Russian-backed Transnistria remains a flashpoint (7053).
   - Criticism of Israel’s Gaza policies may intensify Western debates on self-determination, indirectly bolstering Ukraine’s narrative (7021, 7029).

### Conclusion

Ukraine stands at a critical juncture, balancing military defense against Russia with diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire. While allies like the US, Germany, and Turkey provide crucial support, Hungary’s obstruction and NATO’s caution highlight the fragility of Western unity. Russia’s aggressive tactics and stalling in talks suggest a prolonged conflict, but Ukraine’s resilience and international backing may force incremental diplomatic progress. The broader geopolitical context, including Moldova’s EU aspirations and Israel’s Gaza controversy, underscores the interconnected nature of global conflicts, with Ukraine’s fight for sovereignty resonating as a test of international principles.
