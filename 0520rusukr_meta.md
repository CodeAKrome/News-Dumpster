#### Summary
The articles under Ceasefire Negotiations highlight a complex and contentious effort to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict. **Agreement**: Trump, Putin, and Zelensky all express support for direct talks between Russia and Ukraine, with recent Istanbul negotiations marking a step forward, including a prisoner exchange. The Vatican is repeatedly mentioned as a potential neutral host, supported by Trump and acknowledged by the Kremlin. The UN and Chinese Foreign Minister view these developments positively, seeing them as initial steps toward peace. **Disagreement**: Ukraine and its European allies, including France and Germany, push for an immediate, unconditional 30-day ceasefire, which Russia consistently rejects, with Putin emphasizing the need for detailed agreements addressing "root causes" first. Ukraine, led by Zelensky, refuses to withdraw troops from contested regions like Donetsk, Zaporozhye, and Kherson, a key Russian demand. Trump's reluctance to impose new sanctions on Russia, despite earlier threats, has stunned European leaders and raised concerns in Ukraine about waning US mediation. The Kremlin’s lack of a timeline for a memorandum and Putin’s unilateral ceasefires (e.g., Easter and WWII anniversaries), which Ukraine reports as violated, further underscore Russia’s hesitancy to commit to a full ceasefire, contrasting with Ukraine’s and the West’s urgency for immediate action.
